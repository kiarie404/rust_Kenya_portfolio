### Inserting  background images 

Using .webp files is encouraged over other file formats like .jpeg or .png.  
This is because .webp files...  
1. Have better compression that results in comparably smaller file sizes
2. Improved Quality: Despite the smaller file sizes, WebP can often maintain better image quality compared to JPEG at similar compression levels. 
3. Progressive Loading: WebP images can be encoded as progressive, allowing them to load in stages, starting with a low-quality preview and gradually improving in quality. This provides a perceived faster loading experience for users.
4. Other reasons that I don't know... pretty sure there are others.
